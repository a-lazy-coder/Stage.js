Code Snippets For Web App Development
=====================================
To create a new snippet, select Tools | New Snippet... Sublime Text will present you with an skeleton for it.
Snippets can be stored under any package’s folder, but to keep it simple while you’re learning, you can save them to your Packages/User folder.
You can put the following snippets into the Packages folder to speed up your development with our web app client framework.
e.g `C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\Sublime Text 2\Packages`

The code snippets mirror code found under `app/scripts/modules/context/_examples`
