 * Widget/Editor registry. With a regFacotry to control the registry mech.

 * Important
 * =========
 * Use create() at all times if possible, use get() definition with caution, instanciate only 1 instance per definition.
 * There is something fishy about the initialize() function, events binding only get to execute once with this.listenTo(), if multiple instances of a part
 * listens to a same object's events in their initialize(), only one copy of the group of listeners are active.
