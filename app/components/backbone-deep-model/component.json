(See Installation section below).\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n1. Include Backbone and it's dependencies in your page/app.\n2. Include `lib/underscore.mixin.deepExtend.js` if you haven't already.\n3. Include `src/backbone-deep-model.js`.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThen just have your models extend from Backbone.DeepModel instead of Backbone.Model.\n\nExample code:\n\n    //Create models with nested attributes\n    var model = new Backbone.DeepModel({\n        id: 123,\n        user: {\n            type: 'Spy',\n            name: {\n                first: 'Sterling',\n                last: 'Archer'\n            }\n        },\n        otherSpies: [\n            { name: 'Lana' },\n            { name: 'Cyrril' }\n        ]\n    });\n    \n    //You can bind to change events on nested attributes\n    model.bind('change:user.name.first', function(model, val) {\n        console.log(val);\n    });\n\n    //Wildcards are supported\n    model.bind('change:user.*', function() {});\n    \n    //Use set with a path name for nested attributes\n    //NOTE you must you quotation marks around the key name when using a path\n    model.set({\n        'user.name.first': 'Lana',\n        'user.name.last':  'Kang'\n    });\n    \n    //Use get() with path names so you can create getters later\n    console.log(model.get('user.type'));    // 'Spy'\n\n    //You can use index notation to fetch from arrays\n    console.log(model.get('otherSpies.0.name')) //'Lana'\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nCharles Davison - [powmedia](http://github.com/powmedia)\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\n- [mattyway](https://github.com/mattyway)\n- [AsaAyers](https://github.com/AsaAyers)\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n0.9.0:\n- Support Backbone 0.9.9 (mattyway)\n- Add support for deep model defaults (mattyway)\n\n0.8.0:\n- Allow nested attribute as Model identifier (milosdakic)\n- Add AMD support (drd0rk)\n- Added \"change:*\" event triggers for ancestors of nested attributes. (jessehouchins)\n- JSHint linting (tony)\n- Fix: undefined in setNested resulting from a recent change in backbone master. (evadnoob)\n\n0.7.4:\n- Fix: #22 model.hasChanged() is not reset after change event fires\n- Fix: #18 Setting a deep property to the same value deletes the property (mikefrey)\n- Allow setting nested attributes inside an attribute whose value is currently null (sqs)\n\n0.7.3:\n- Add DeepModel.keyPathSeparator to allow using custom path separators\n\n0.7.2:\n- Check if the child object exists, but isn't an object. #12 (tgriesser)\n\n0.7.1:\n- Model.changedAttributes now works with nested attributes.\n- Fix getting attribute that is an empty object\n\n0.7:\n- Update for Backbone v0.9.2\n",
